- Keep SqlChain free of references to specific IQToolkit or ADO.NET providers. All providers should
  be retrieved dynamically when needed, so that a project not using a particular DBMS doesn't need
  to include DLLs pertaining to it.
  
  Strictly speaking it's probably possible to get away with using some specific references that never
  get executed, but so far there's no need for them. Let's keep it that way "by default", and review this
  policy if the need arises.

  Base classes, such as DbConnection for example, should be used to comply with the above. Create
  specific instances dynamically where necessary - e.g. see DbProviderFactories.
  
  The IQToolkit provider implementations should be referenced from the application using SqlChain.
  The application should reference the IQToolkit libraries for all providers it intends to support, even
  if it doesn't directly use the types defined in those libraries. This is so that the build process copies
  the DLLs to the build output directory.
